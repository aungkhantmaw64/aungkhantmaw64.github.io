## Hey there! How's it going?

My name is **Aung Khant Maw**, a Burmese embedded systems engineer from Myanmar. My non-Burmese friends call me **Rick**!

I write technical blog posts in my free time.
Some articles I discuss may sound too basic, while others may seem advanced.
Some of these may contain experiences unique to me, or things that you might have never heard of.
Most of the time, I write with my younger self in mind, focusing on topics that I wished someone had written for me, when I was starting out in my career.

I write my blogs the same way I develop software: iteratively.
Instead of writing the entire blog in one go, I keep improving it; a small chunk, a paragraph or a sentence at a time.
So, some of them may often feel unfinished or even forgotten.
But, hey, I'm not writing professionally and don't get paid for this. I'm not obligated to finish what I've started.
However, I'll try my best not to leave my blog posts unfinished as much as possible.
Plus, I'm writing for myself so that I can always look back on what I learned or experienced later in my life.

## A Little Bit About Myself

Of course, I'm not going to put my entire career history here. This is not LinkedIn.
If you are curious about my professional profile, you can always go check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aungkhantmaw/). You can also visit my [Github profile](https://github.com/aungkhantmaw64), which you will encounter most often in my blog posts.

I have more than 5 years of experience in the embedded industry. The majority of my work includes wireless connectivity, mesh networking and device driver developments.

Here are the topics that interest me most and that I'd like to write about:

- Embedded Linux (Yocto, Buildroot, OpenWrt)
- Single Board Computers
- TinyML (Machine Learning in Resource-Constrained Devices)
- Distributed Embedded Systems (Mesh Networks and IoT Connectivity)
- Firmware Architecture & Design Patterns
- Real-Time Operating Systems, and
- Robotics

By the way, I have also published an `IEEE` article on an _electronic nose_ that I designed while I was studying for my master's degree.
If you are curious about how I applied machine learning in a multisensory system, you can check it out [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9495905). The system consists of a metal oxide gas sensor array and a hand-fabricated paper-based colorimetric sensor.
